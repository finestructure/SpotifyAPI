     * Artist
     * Show

   One of the following:
 
   * `position(Int)`: The index of the item in the context at which to
     start playback. Cannot be used if the context is an artist.
   *  `uri(SpotifyURIConvertible)`: The URI of the item to start playback at.
 
 * positionMS: Indicates from what position to start playback in
   milliseconds. If `nil`, then the track/episode will start from
   the beginning. Passing in a position that is greater than the
   length of the track/episode will cause the player to start playing
   the next item.
